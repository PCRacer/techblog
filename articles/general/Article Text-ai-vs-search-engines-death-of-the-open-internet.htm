<p data-start="761" data-end="1285">Over the past two years, user interaction with online platforms has undergone a seismic shift. Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the form of conversational agents like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others, is steadily overtaking traditional search engines in how users retrieve information, shop, and perform online research. The era of "Googling it" is gradually being replaced by "Asking AI," and while the convenience is undeniable, the broader consequences for the internet ecosystem are growing increasingly dire.</p><p data-start="761" data-end="1285"><br></p>

<p data-start="1165" data-end="1489">Most AI models are trained on vast amounts of publicly available data — which includes blog posts, product reviews, research papers, how-to guides, opinion pieces, and community discussions. These data sources, many of them created by independent individuals or small organizations, become part of the AI's "knowledge base."</p>
<p data-start="1491" data-end="1810">However, unlike traditional search engines which <strong data-start="1540" data-end="1601">drive traffic back to the original creators through links</strong>, AI-generated content <strong data-start="1624" data-end="1649">disguises its origins</strong>, rarely pointing back to specific sources.

<p data-start="5597" data-end="5903">We are at a pivotal moment in digital history. AI’s promise is massive — it can democratize access to knowledge, simplify decision-making, and enhance productivity. But if left unchecked, it also threatens to erode the very foundation of the open internet: diversity, discoverability, and decentralization.</p>
<p data-start="5905" data-end="6123">The death of independent websites, if allowed to continue, will not be due to censorship, government overreach, or lack of innovation — <strong data-start="6041" data-end="6123">but due to the convenience of AI replacing the messiness of human exploration.</strong></p>
